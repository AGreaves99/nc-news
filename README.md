# NC News Frontend

This is the front-end application for **NC News**, a Reddit-style news platform where users can browse articles, read comments, vote, and interact with various topics. This front-end project is built using React and interacts with a RESTful API to fetch and display data dynamically.

- View a list of articles
- Filter articles by topics
- Sort articles by date, comments count, and votes
- View individual article details with associated comments
- Post and delete comments
- Vote on articles and comments
